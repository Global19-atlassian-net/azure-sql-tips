# Contributions

We welcome and encourage contributions to this project. You can open [issues](../../azure-sql-tools/issues) to report bugs and suggest improvements or new tips, or send [pull requests](../../azure-sql-tools/pulls) to contribute code.

We request that you keep the following guidelines in mind:

1. A new tip or a change to an existing tip must be implementable in T-SQL using the current surface area of Azure SQL Database;
2. A new tip or a change to an existing tip must be useful to a significant portion of Azure SQL Database customers;
3. The implementation must be lightweight, i.e. it should not cause high resource utilization or contention that may impact running workloads, and should not cause the script to run for an excessively long time.

The last two guidelines are clearly subjective; we will use community input and our best judgement when considering contributions.
